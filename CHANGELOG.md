# Implementation changelog and handoff

## Current state — 2026-10-10

- Active goal: implement the full PDD with a phase → whole-repo audit → GitHub issues → fixes gate after every phase, and deploy medallion data on Databricks Free Edition for Power BI.
- Current phase: **Phase 1 in progress**. No phase is declared complete; no Gold data is deployed.
- Start here: `docs/PLAN.md` (tasks and exit criteria), `docs/DECISIONS.md` (PDD corrections), then latest `docs/audits/` report.
- Repository started with only README and PDD at commit `41efc69`, branch `main`; no pre-existing implementation or AGENTS.md found.

## Work completed

### 2026-10-10 — Full PDD review and project baseline

- Read all 407 body elements, every schema, six SQL queries, GBM example, roadmap, and appendices. OOXML footnote/endnote/comment parts contain no substantive text.
- Identified VaR/CVaR inconsistency, incorrect latest-price selection, plain-moment vs EWM mismatch, daily/weekly annualization risk, broken correlation query, MTM sign contradiction, missing flights/raw-path schemas, unsupported partition expression and MAX(UUID) run selection.
- Created detailed four-phase plan with requirement mapping, phase audit gates, explicit external validation, and Power BI readiness milestone.
- Checked primary Databricks/EIA/Microsoft documentation. Free Edition is serverless; Spark RDD APIs and indefinite streaming triggers are unavailable. Adaptation documented.
- Added `.gitignore`, public `.env.example`, and empty local `.env` for workspace/EIA credentials.
- GitHub access attempts: CLI authentication invalid; connector repo lookup 404 and issue search permission 422. Asked user to restore access. No issues created yet.
- DOCX render helper attempted; Windows runtime provides no bundled LibreOffice and rendering did not succeed. Full text/OOXML inspection succeeded; source untouched.

## Next actions

1. Implement Phase 1 package, safe config and EIA client, immutable Bronze capture, Silver enrichment and weekly sampling, tests/CI and Free Edition staging/streaming notebook.
2. Run local tests, then audit entire repo; write findings to `docs/audits/phase-01.md` and file on GitHub once access works. Resolve and verify findings before moving to Phase 2.
3. When user supplies credentials in `.env`, validate Databricks connection without printing secrets; bootstrap managed schemas/volume; run and record live Bronze/Silver checks.
4. Do not mark deployment, audit filing, or Power BI readiness complete based on local tests alone.

## Blockers requiring external input

- Databricks URL and credentials, warehouse ID/permissions; empty `.env` prepared. User has been asked for workspace URL.
- EIA API key for real ingestion.
- GitHub access restored: the CLI works outside the Windows sandbox. Use escalated `gh`/Git network calls; connector remains inaccessible.

### 2026-10-10 — Phase 1 implementation underway

- Created `codex/pdd-implementation`; user explicitly requested incremental commits and pushes.
- Implemented safe literal environment loading and credential-free representations, HTTPS workspace validation, EIA pagination/retries/redaction, immutable local capture manifests and integrity checks, Silver revision/unit/value validation and actual calendar analytics, weekly sampling and a local CLI.
- Added packaging and CI definition plus 12 unit tests. First run: 10 passed; two filesystem tests blocked by Windows sandbox temp-directory permissions. Rerun with workspace-local TEMP/TMP is next; no product failure inferred from those permission errors.
- GitHub CLI outside sandbox confirms successful login, private-repository access, and no existing issues. Earlier auth failure was sandbox-specific.
- Saved user-provided workspace origin in ignored `.env`. Token and EIA key remain absent; token pasted in chat was not persisted or used, and user was asked to replace it locally.
- No live Databricks deployment or real price ingestion yet. Phase 1 gate remains open.

## Verification ledger

| Check | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Git working tree before changes | Clean |
| Entire PDD extraction and OOXML notes | Complete |
| Repo instructions | No AGENTS.md found in repository/checked ancestor locations |
| GitHub CLI authentication | Invalid token |
| GitHub connector repository access | 404 / search permission error |
| Databricks live access | Not attempted; URL/token absent |
| Local implementation tests | Pending |

## Changelog maintenance contract

Append dated entries after meaningful implementation/checks, include exact commands, failed attempts, actual issue URLs and fixed files. Keep Current state, Next actions and Blockers accurate. Every phase audit records coverage, findings, GitHub status and closure evidence. A successor must be able to resume without chat history.
